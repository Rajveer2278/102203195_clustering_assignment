# 102203195_clustering_assignment

This repository implements multiple clustering algorithms on the Iris dataset and evaluates their performance using three different clustering evaluation metrics:

Silhouette Score
Calinski-Harabasz Index
Davies-Bouldin Index
Clustering Algorithms Implemented:
Spectral Clustering
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Fuzzy C-Means
Data Preprocessing Techniques:
The following data preprocessing methods are applied:

Standard Scaling
Min-Max Scaling
Normalization
The preprocessing methods are applied to the Iris dataset, and the clustering algorithms are evaluated on various cluster numbers (3, 5, and 7).

Evaluation Metrics:
The clustering results are evaluated using three metrics:

Silhouette Score: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The higher the value, the better.
Calinski-Harabasz Index: Measures the ratio of the sum of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. Higher values are better.
Davies-Bouldin Index: Measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar one. Lower values indicate better clustering.
Code Summary:
Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed using Standard Scaling, Min-Max Scaling, and Normalization.
Clustering: Spectral Clustering, GMM, and Fuzzy C-Means are applied to the data.
Evaluation: Each clustering result is evaluated using the three mentioned metrics.

Requirements:
To run this code, ensure the following packages are installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
skfuzzy
You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn skfuzzy
How to Run:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies.
Run the clustering.py file (or your respective script) to see the clustering results and evaluation metrics.
Visualizations:
The clustering results for each algorithm are visualized using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction. Each algorithmâ€™s result is plotted with a different number of clusters (3, 5, and 7) to give a visual understanding of the clustering quality.
